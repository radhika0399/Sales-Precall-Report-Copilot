Why to use Agent and not ChatGPT ?

1. Agent only crawls required upto date information from given URLs and not the irreleavant data like ChatGPT
2. ChatGPT most of the times do text search and gives false information about companies as it not only uses Linkedin data but also lot of references of text on other random sites .For above example chatgpt will give you wrong data too as below.

   Put the same prompt above in ChatGPT and see the results of company summary and check below entry refering to  

  _ One UK/Scottish registered entity shows “dormant” status, which may reflect a subsidiary or registration detail.
